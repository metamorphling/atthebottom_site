    <h2 class="underline-border">This blog</h2>
<p>This is my personal blog where I write down my thoughts on industry and code. Just in case, nothing I write here is related to my employers.</p>

<h2 class="underline-border">Ryazan</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/images/ryazan.jpg" alt="alt text" title="Ryazan kremlin" class="image-centered" /></p>

<p>Born in Russia, small city of Ryazan, a few hours ride from Moscow. Spent here all my years up to moving abroad. Somehow graduated from Ryazan Radio Engineering University(Software Engineering and Information Systems Management). Somehow, as in I dropped out before writing thesis. I was already earning more than I ever need and university was getting in the way of work. Once I learned that to get a specialist visa in other country one needs to finish a university, got back and did my thesis.</p>

<h2 class="underline-border">Sapporo</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/images/sapporo.jpg" alt="alt text" title="Sapporo Oodori" class="image-centered" /></p>

<p>Beautiful city of Sapporo, northern capital of Japan. Moved there in 2015 and enjoyed this place for a little bit more than 2 years. At the time factually worked at ADI, in reality worked on dispatch at Fujisoft. Working by day, exploring city by night. Did travel all over Hokkaido, good times. <br />
At some point realized that my childhood dream of working in gamedev is still burning bright, so I studied Unity in my extra-professional time. Since there aren’t many opportunities in Sapporo, my humble self-made portfolio led me to mobile game development company in Tokyo.</p>

<h2 class="underline-border">Tokyo</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/images/tokyo.jpg" alt="alt text" title="Tokyo Kabukicho" class="image-centered" /></p>

<p>This time an actual capital. Moved in 2018 to work at Opus(“Half-Minute Hero” guys), still living here. All I can say is that we have love and hate relationships with this city. In my professional time I released a few mobile games: slot machine and card battle roguelike, both with gacha mechanics. Made a lot of friends at Opus and I’m forever grateful for opportunities I got there.</p>

<h2 class="underline-border">From Software</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/images/from.jpg" alt="alt text" title="From Software Logo" class="image-centered" /></p>

<p>2020 brought me some surprises(besides COVID, yeah), and I managed to get into AAA game development company. Currently working as R&amp;D engineer at From Software.</p>
